He has a stunning wife and a beautiful daughter. They are a good family.

Fred is a good man. He always pays taxes on time, treats everyone politely, and makes sure all his business transactions stay off the books, just the way people prefer.

There is nothing wrong with his life.

Fred loves his lives. So as others.

They too wants Fred lives.

Especially the police and the investigators. But, however many times they tried, they can never have it.

So, they took what Fred loves most. His family. But, it was a mistake.

Now Fred wants their lives.
